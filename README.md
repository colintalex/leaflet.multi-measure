# leaflet.multiMeasure
2D Area/Length/Coordinate Measure Plugin for Leaflet

Inspired by the original Leaflet Measure - https://github.com/ljagis/leaflet-measure

This a weekend project, updates are imminent the next time it rains :)

Due to a lack of activty on the repo and a personal curioustity, I rebuilt this plugin with certain enhancements:
- Removes use of unsafe-eval
- Breaks out Measurements into seperate Point/Line/Area
- Adds Undo Last action

Future upgrades:
- Edit vertexes on saved measurements.
